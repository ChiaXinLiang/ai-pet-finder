      "My name is Ginger. I am a playful dog who enjoys the company of my human friends and playing with toys. I would do best in a home with people who love the personalities of German Shepherds and who are already familiar with or wish to learn positive reinforcement training. I am part of a loyal breed, and it has been hard for me as I have been passed around many homes. Because of this, I will also need some adjustment time to settle in and bond with you. I will need a home without dogs as I was never socialized with them and now I do not do well with other dogs. However, in previous homes I lived with other types of animals and my former family said I did well, but it may be best for me to live with people and no other animals, just to make things easier for everyone. I would also benefit from a 6-foot fenced in yard to play fetch in.",

      "My name is Earl and my friends at OHS say that I am a very good boy!  \n  \nWhat do my friends here say about me? First off, I'm an active guy, and I'd love to go on adventures with you, or even just a stroll around the neighborhood. I'm a big fan of toys too, and squeaky toys are especially great! I'm always up for a romp around the yard together!  \n  \nToys are also a great way to teach me new things! I'm quite smart and already know some cues like 'sit' 'lay down' and 'shake' - I'd love to learn more with you!  \n  \nNow, toys are great and all, but my humans are even better! I'm confident and make friends wherever I go. After I get my energy out, I'd love to snuggle up on the couch together. I may even sleep with my head in your lap!  \n  \nAs far as other animals go, I've done well meeting other dogs here at the shelter, but I'm not big on cats, and I'll need a home without them to live my best life! I wouldn't mind soaking up all the love for myself either.",
